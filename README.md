transloadit-drag-and-drop
=========================

This is a prorotype to get drag and drop to work with Transloadit's jQuery plugin.

You need to use the custom version of Transloadit's jQuery plugin attached to this.


## Usage

Please see index.html for how to use it and how to add your Transloadit settings.

## Caution

This is meant as a working prototype, which has bugs (like no support for custom form fields).
We will add support for the official plugin for this soon.
